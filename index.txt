props.children - when you pass anything to a component element between opening and closing tags, React sends it to a 
prop called children that cn be accessed by passing the children prop


to these created components, you can add normal html attributes and listenersby passing them in the correct formart as props
and then using the object spread operator to pass them into the specific elements you want the attributes to apply

when doing object desctructuring, you can use a ...rest - (replace rest with whatever) eg, { name , location , ...rest }
this will destructure name and location and then put al other key-vaue pairs in an object called rest
